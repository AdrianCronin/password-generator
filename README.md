# Password-Generator

Deployed appilcation: https://adriancronin.github.io/password-generator/

## Description
A simple password generator made with Javascript that takes user input for how long and how complex the password will be.
* Motivation for this project was to build an simple tool that can be used to generate strong passwords for different sets of criteria.
* I built this is to get a better understanding of javascript arrays and how to manipulate them and the data contained in them. As well as getting practice building functions, passing arguments from user input or earlier parts of the code, and returning values from those functions.
* This tool can help solve the problem of using the same password in many places, unfortunately the passwords generated are nonsensical and difficult to remember so some sort of password-saving service is recommended.
* In addition to learning about arrays and functions, I learned about what Math.floor and Math.random do and how they can be used to generate random whole numbers and then use those random numbers to access random indexes in arrays.
